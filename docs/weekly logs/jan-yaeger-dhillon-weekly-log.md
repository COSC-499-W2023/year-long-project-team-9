### In Progress ###
- This week I focused mainly on planning out how the application is going to work in terms of UI/UX. I created a logo and got a solid draft for the landing page on Figma and contributed to creating an identity for our project. I worked on researching the AWS services such as Amplify and how we can best implement them into our app.
