- This week I focused mainly on planning out how the application is going to work in terms of UI/UX. I created a logo and got a solid draft for the landing page on Figma and contributed to creating an identity for our project. I worked on researching the AWS services such as Amplify and how we can best implement them into our app.
- Specifically from our project board, I completed `Design logo` and worked with my team to complete `Come up with name for the web-app` and `Fix Github branching issue`.
- Looking ahead, I intend to complete `Create Figma design for home page` in the very near future and start working on implementing the technologies such as `Set up Next.js for the project` and `Set up AWS Amplify for the project`.
