I also stepped in to help with `Write Project Plan - Section 4, Teamwork Distribution and Anticipated Hurdles` and `Write Project Plan - Section 2, Major Milestones`.
- I did a lot of research and planning on the technologies and services we will be using.

- Specifically from our project board, I completed `Design logo` and worked with my team to complete `Come up with name for the web-app` and `Fix Github branching issue`.
- Looking ahead, I intend to complete `Create Figma design for home page` in the very near future and start working on implementing the technologies such as `Set up Next.js for the project` and `Set up AWS Amplify for the project`.   
- This week I focused mainly on planning out how the application is going to work in terms of UI/UX. I created a logo and got a solid draft for the landing page on Figma and contributed to creating an identity for our project. I worked on researching the AWS services such as Amplify and how we can best implement them into our app.

### In Progress ###
- I am still working on the Figma design for the home page. I am also working on researching the AWS services and how we can best implement them into our app.

## Week 6 & 7 ##

### Applicable Date Range ###
October 9 - October 22, 2023

### Tasks Worked On ###

- My goals this week were to lay a strong foundation for the project and did a lot of work towards Milestone #2: Mini Presentation. 
- I finialized my design for the landing page on Figma and got a strong start on implementing it in Next. 
- Speaking of, I set up Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and the other front end technologies. 
- I also set up AWS Amplify for our project and hosted out web app (https://amplify.ds4nt6byy9rfg.amplifyapp.com/). However, I still have yet to fully set up the CLI and configure Amplify. 
- I also started looking into how I am going to implement Lambda, Step Functions, CodeBuild, and CodePipeline. 
- Behind the scenes, I have been learning a lot about Docker and containerization which will eventually come into play when we start to implement the video processing. I also attended all meetings and classes.
- I think I did well this week and aim to continue working hard to achieve optimal results.
