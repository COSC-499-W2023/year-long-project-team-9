## About Us
A short blurb about the website intented to be used on the About Us section of the home page.
> Welcome to Obscurus.me. The brand new destination for your video processing needs. We aim to create a service to streamline the process of requesting videos from other users to a simple and easy process. In todayâ€™s digital age, privacy is a vital concern for many of us. We allow users to upload videos, and within minutes Obscurus will censor any faces found in it. 

## Tagline
We came up with a lot of drafts for taglines before deciding on this one. 
`Experience seamless face blurring and video delivery with Obscurus`

## Features 
On our home page we wanted to highlight the key features of Obscurus. Originally we wanted to talk about our automatic face detection and blurring, the ease of video processing and user privacy, however these were very generic and didn't fully capture our services with online communication.

In the end we decided to list the folling features:<br>
<b>Private Video Requests</b>
> Initiate confidential conversations through secure video requests. Our platform ensures your communication remains private and encrypted 

<b>Seamless Video Submissions</b>
> Respondents can easily record and submit videos through a secure link, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience

<b>Private Video Requests</b>
> Our advanced face-blurring technology offers respondents an extra layer of privacy, activated by requests. 

## Process Walkthrough
Person A works as a recruiter for a company, they need B, C, and D to submit a video demonstrating their skills. to ensure that the person choosing won't make a biased choice. A creates an account on Obscurus -> creates request -> fill in information -> sends email to users -> users sign up -> record video -> Obscurus processes the video (blurring if required) -> A receives the videos 

## User Groups
- Professional recruiters who need a demonstration of a client's skills (Eg sports team recruiters)
- Users who need an anonymous video of a person (Eg anonymous testimonies, auditions, tutoring)
